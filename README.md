# James Armstrong's Technical Writing Samples 

Hiring manager or recruiter? _You found the right place._ 

## About Me ✍️
My north star is customer advocacy. Customers should move from the initial "What now?" to "Wow!" in a tiny increment of space-time. They should, really, because they didn't buy the product to be confronted with _learning_ it. They want the product to snap into their workflow and trigger business growth. It never really works that way, though, does it? Which is where my experience, training, and skills enter.

How do I get that developer from Now to Wow - not knowing whether they are a beginner, an executive, a no-coder, a low-coder, or a particularly salty lead dev who likes to offer doc feedback? You may glean something of my approach, innovations, and incantations as you explore my samples.

> Or schedule some time to talk! Let's see if my blend of skills and talent is the answer to the problems you need to solve.


## 1. Python/AI Project:
- **Python / AI.** Worked on a Python web development project since December, experiencing firsthand the friction points for developers during the SDLC. I built a [website experience with a semi-automated backend](https://www.findyourcountry.com), a test suite, a structured JSON file as a database, together with combined inputs from Claude, Perplexity, and ChatGPT APIs. 

## 2. Salesforce:
- **Developer Documentation / Content Strategy.** I planned and performed a complete restructuring of the Salesforce Bulk API Developer Guides and carefully maintained them. [PDF](James_Armstrong_Salesforce_Samples_of_Developer_Documentation.pdf) or [online](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.252.0.api_asynch.meta/api_asynch/asynch_api_intro.htm).
- **Help Guides.** I was responsible for documenting the [External Services](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=platform.external_services.htm&type=5) product, which imports an OpenAPI-compliant specification, and transforms each operation into invocable actions that you declaratively call from within Salesforce. 
- **Training / Video Production.** For the [External Services Trailhead](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/trails/access-business-processes-with-external-services) learning modules, I redesigned the entire learning experience and produced clear, instructional videos that introduce key concepts and demonstrate ideal workflows for the External Services product. **These efforts contributed to a 50% increase in customer adoption and boosted online training completion rates from 49% to over 80%**.

## 3. Microsoft / Ericsson:
I wrote for the Mediaroom product (think "AT&T U-verse"). This [collection of samples](James_Armstrong_Microsoft_Samples.pdf) includes:
- **Change Management.** Examples of the format I developed to enable cumulative change logging that was easily understood by Mediaroom customers.
- **Diagrams.** Examples of the design principles I developed to create logical, useful diagrams that enable customers to quickly understand data flows between system components. The primary audience was system administrators tasked with troubleshooting issues.
- **Task-oriented Docs.** Examples that demonstrate clarity in task-oriented documentation.
- **Content Strategy.** I completely reorganized two books using a feature-oriented scheme. The new organization had the following advantages:
  - Made locating content simple and predictable for readers.
  - Made finding a location for new content very easy for writers.
  - Made the technical review process much easier, as all relevant content for a given feature was located in the same place.

Beyond the option of do nothing at all, or moving on to reviewing other candidates, why not schedule a call now to discuss what it is that you need and exactly how it is that I can help?
Will the other options help to increase the total customer experience? Adoption? Enablement? Retention? 

Thanks very much for your time and consideration.
