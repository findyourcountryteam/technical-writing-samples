# James Armstrong's technical-writing-samples 
Hiring manager or recruiter? You're definitely in the right place.

In the Samples folder, you'll find PDFs of projects I worked on at Salesforce and Microsoft.
My Python/AI Project (FindMyCountry.com)
- Working on a Python web development project since December, experiencing firsthand the friction points for developers during the SDLC.   I built a [website experience with a semi-automated backend](https://findmycountry.com), a test suite, a structured JSON file as a database, together with combined inputs from Claude, Perplexity, and ChatGPT APIs. 

Salesforce (5 years):
- I planned and performed a complete restructuring of the Salesforce Bulk API Developer Guides and carefully maintained them. [PDF](James_Armstrong_Salesforce_Samples_of_Developer_Documentation.pdf) or [online](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.252.0.api_asynch.meta/api_asynch/asynch_api_intro.htm).
- I was responsible for documenting the External Services product, which imports an OpenAPI-compliant specification, and transforms each operation into invocable actions that you declaratively call from within Salesforce. 
- For the External Services Trailhead learning modules, I redesigned the entire learning experience, and produced clear, instructional videos that introduce key concepts and demonstrate ideal workflows for the External Services product. These efforts contributed to a 50% increase in customer adoption and boosted online training completion rates from 49% to over 80%.

Microsoft / Ericsson (10 years):
