# James Armstrong's Technical Writing Samples 

Hiring manager or recruiter? _You found the right place._ 

All personal quotes in this document are from my [LinkedIn Recommendations](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tojamesarmstrong/details/recommendations/?detailScreenTabIndex=0).

## About Me ✍️
My north star is customer advocacy. Customers should move from the initial "What now?" to "Wow!" in a tiny increment of space-time. They should, really, because they didn't buy the product to be confronted with _learning_ it. They want the product to snap into their workflow and trigger business growth. It never really works that way, though, does it? This is where my experience, training, and skills come in handy.

How do I get that developer from "What now?" to "Wow!" - not knowing whether they are a beginner, an executive, a no-coder, a low-coder, or a particularly salty lead dev who likes to offer doc feedback? You may glean something of my approach, innovations, and incantations as you explore my samples.

Or, schedule some time to talk! Let's see if my blend of skills and talent is the answer to the problems you need to solve.


## 1. Python/AI Project:
- **Python / AI / UX.** Worked on a Python web development project since December, developed the UI/UX, and experienced firsthand the friction points for developers during the SDLC. I built a [website experience with a semi-automated backend](https://www.findyourcountry.com), a test suite, a structured JSON file as a database, together with combined inputs from Claude, Perplexity, and ChatGPT APIs. 

## 2. Salesforce:
- **Developer Documentation / Content Strategy.** I planned and performed a complete restructuring of the Salesforce Bulk API Developer Guides and carefully maintained them. [PDF](James_Armstrong_Salesforce_Samples_of_Developer_Documentation.pdf) or [online](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.252.0.api_asynch.meta/api_asynch/asynch_api_intro.htm).
> "... the result has been a collection of documentation that allows users to get to the information they need more efficiently and effectively, deflecting support cases, and activating more API consumers to leverage the newer, more modern service." - Kris Harrison, Senior Director of Product Management at Salesforce, Integration Services
- **Help Guides / UX.** I was responsible for documenting the [External Services](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=platform.external_services.htm&type=5) product, which imports an OpenAPI-compliant specification, and transforms each operation into invocable actions that you declaratively call from within Salesforce.
> "...He collaborates closely with product and engineering leads, and considers the full product context before content planning. James puts the user first; his content is clear, concise, and follows the natural path users take when learning or working with a product." - Catherine Adams, Lead Technical Writer at Salesforce 
- **Training / Video Production.** For the [External Services Trailhead](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/trails/access-business-processes-with-external-services) learning modules, I redesigned the entire learning experience. I produced clear, instructional videos that introduce key concepts and demonstrate ideal workflows for the External Services product. 
> "James transformed our product documentation and Trailhead modules into an engaging experience for customers. Thanks to his innovative approach, Trailhead completion rates jumped from 50% to over 70%, significantly boosting customer enablement. He consistently went above and beyond, contributing to UX design for every release and ensuring a frictionless user experience. James' attention to detail and collaborative spirit made him an invaluable partner on the team." - Andrea Guzman, Senior Product Manager at Salesforce

> "James was an early adopter of AI for technical writing and eagerly shared his insights and expertise with others. Shortly after the debut of ChatGPT, James and I curated an online prompt library for technical writers at Salesforce, which we continue to use today!" - Richard Sexton, Principal Technical Writer at Salesforce
## 3. Microsoft / Ericsson:
I wrote for the Mediaroom product (think "AT&T U-verse"). This [collection of samples](James_Armstrong_Microsoft_Samples.pdf) includes:
- **Change Management.** Examples of the format I developed to enable cumulative change logging that was easily understood by Mediaroom customers.
- **Diagrams.** Examples of the design principles I developed to create logical, useful diagrams that enable customers to quickly understand data flows between system components. The primary audience was system administrators tasked with troubleshooting issues.
- **Task-oriented Docs.** Examples that demonstrate clarity in task-oriented documentation.
- **Content Strategy.** I completely reorganized two books using a feature-oriented scheme. The new organization had the following advantages:
  - Made locating content simple and predictable for readers.
  - Made finding a location for new content very easy for writers.
  - Made the technical review process much easier, as all relevant content for a given feature was located in the same place.
> "... At one point, he undertook a very successful months-long reorganization and revamp of our client documentation. The client program manager described this undertaking as 'a big, risky project that really paid off and added significant value to the product.'" - David Aitken, Content Publishing Manager at Microsoft

Beyond the option of doing nothing at all or moving on to reviewing other candidates, why not schedule a call now to discuss what you need and exactly how I can help?
Will the other options help to increase the total customer experience? Adoption? Enablement? Retention? 

Thanks very much for your time and consideration.
